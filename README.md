# hello-world
I'm new to using github. I plan to upload code I have been storing in private to my github for public viewing.

I'm not sure about which licenses I will choose. Factors in this decision include my tendency to favor free use of software, but also restricting companies from using my software for their own benefit with no attribution or giving back to myself or others. Another factor is my desire to protect my ability to earn compensation for my work.
